       FvwmSaveDesk - another FVWM desktop-layout saving module


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmSaveDesk  is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invo-
       cation will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       When called, this module will attempt to save your current
       desktop layout as a fvwm function definition into the file
       <I>.fvwmdesk</I> in your home directory. The  function  is  named
       <I>StartupFunction</I>  <I>InitFunction</I>  to startup all Programms on
       all Workspaces.  If fvwm is compiled with the  M4  option,
       you  can  include  this  file  in  <I>.fvmrc</I> else you have to
       insert this file by hand.  Your applications  must  supply
       certain hints to the X window system.  Emacs, for example,
       does not, so FvwmSaveDesk can't get any  information  from
       it.

       Also,  FvwmSaveDesk  assumes  that  certain  command  line
       options are globally accepted by applications,  which  may
       not be the case.



</PRE>
<H2>SETUP IF FVWM IS COMPILED WITH THE M4 OPTION</H2><PRE>
       Fvwm has to be called with the option

       -m4opt -I$HOME.

       The first line in .fvwmrc should be

       undefine(`include`),

       to avoid problems.  You can the include the file <I>.fvwmdesk</I>
       with

       sinclude(`.fvwmdesk') .

       Insert the following line into the Function <I>InitFunction</I>

       Function "I"    StartupFunction

       If you have GNU's m4 another possiblity is to compile fvwm
       with GNU_M4_OPTION_P and use

       m4_include(`.fvwmdesk')m4_dnl

       So you don't need to undefine `include'.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
       FvwmSaveDesk  can be invoked by inserting the line 'Module
       Fvwm will search directory  specified  in  the  ModulePath
       configuration option to attempt to locate FvwmSaveDesk.
