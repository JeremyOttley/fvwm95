       FvwmWharf - the AfterStep application "dock" module ported
       to Fvwm.


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmWharf is spawned by Fvwm, so no command  line  invoca-
       tion will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The FvwmWharf module is a free-floating application loader
       that can execute programs, "Swallow" running programs, and
       contain   "Folders"  of  more  applications,  among  other
       things.  The user can press the first button at  any  time
       to  trigger  invocation  of one of these functions, or the
       user can press button two in order  to  cause  the  entire
       Wharf  to  withdraw  to  the nearest corner in an iconized
       state.  FvwmWharf only works when Fvwm is used as the win-
       dow manager.

       this  module  to the Window Manager, are all original work

<H2>INITIALIZATION</H2><PRE>
       During initialization, <I>FvwmWharf</I> will search for a config-
       uration file which describes the  button  panel  geometry,
       color, icons, and actions. The format of this file will be
       described later. The configuration file will  be  the  one
       which Fvwm used during its initialization.

       If  the FvwmWharf executable is linked to another name, ie
       ln -s FvwmWharf Pier, then another module called Pier  can
       be started, with a completely different configuration than
       FvwmWharf, simply by changing the keywords FvwmWharf??? to
       Pier???. This way multiple button-bars can be used.

<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The following options can be placed in the .steprc file


       *FvwmWharfAnimate
              If specified, the opening and  closing  of  Folders
              will  be  animated, rather than simply drawn in one
              frame.


       *FvwmWharfAnimateMain
              Designates that full-length Wharf windraws will  be
              animated.


       *FvwmWharfBgColor <I>color</I>
              If    <I>*FvwmWharfTextureType</I>    <I>0</I>    is   specified,
              <I>FvwmWharf</I>'s buttons will be filled with <I>color</I>.


       *FvwmWharfColumns <I>columns</I>
              Specifies the number of columns of  buttons  to  be
              created. If unspecified, the number of columns will
              be set to 1.  If the columns are set  to  a  number
              greater  than  1  then there will be that number of
              columns with enough rows to satisfy  the  requested
              number of buttons.


       *FvwmWharfForceSize
              If  specified, will force pixmaps larger than 64x64
              to the default size.  Pixmaps  smaller  than  64x64
              are not supported.


       *FvwmWharfFullPush
              If  specified,  the  entire  FvwmWharf button back-
              ground will be moved down and  to  the  right  when
              pushed.   Especially useful with *FvwmWharfNoBorder
              textures.


       *FvwmWharfGeometry <I>geometry</I>
              Specifies  the  FvwmWharf  window  location  and/or
              size.  If the size is not specified, FvwmWharf will
              auto-size itself in a reasonable manner.  The geom-
              etry  is  a standard X11 window geometry specifica-
              tion.  This option is pre-set in  the  NEXTSTEP(tm)
              style  section  for a consistent look and feel with
              NEXTSTEP(tm).  Secondary FvwmWharf invocations from
              Specifies  the maximum <I>number</I> of colors to use on a
              gradient fill.


       *FvwmWharfNoBorder
              Denotes that beveled borders should  not  be  drawn
              around  the FvwmWharf button.  Useful with textures
              that include their own bevels.


       *FvwmWharfPixmap <I>pixmap</I>
              Sets the pixmap file to be used as <I>FvwmWharf</I>'s but-
              ton.  To be used with <I>*FvwmWharfTextureType</I> <I>128</I>.


       *FvwmWharfTextureColor <I>from</I> <I>to</I>
              When  used  with a <I>*FvwmWharfTextureType</I> of 1 to 5,
              designates the ends of the  gradient  range  to  be
              used on <I>FvwmWharf</I>'s buttons.


       *FvwmWharfTextureType  <I>type</I>
              Specifies  the  type of gradient fill to be used on
              <I>FvwmWharf</I>'s buttons.  Valid values are:
              0 - No texture - use <I>FvwmWharfBgColor</I> to set the desired color
              1 - Gradient from upper-left to lower right
              2 - Horizontal one way gradient from top to bottom
              3 - Horizontal cylindrical gradient from top/bottom to center
              4 - Vertical one way gradient from left to right
              5 - Vertical cylindrical gradient from left/right to center
              128 - User specified pixmap
              The  default  is  the  builtin  <I>FvwmWharf</I>   texture
              pixmap.


       *FvwmWharf <I>label</I> <I>icon</I> <I>command</I>
              Specifies  a  window  manager  built-in  command or
              folder  to  activate  (folders  will  be  discussed
              below),  as  described  in the Fvwm man page, which
              should be executed when a button  is  pressed.  The
              label  field  is  an  internal  item  that is still
              around from the GoodStuff module.  The  icon  field
              specifies  an X11 bitmap file, XPM color icon file,
              or a comma-delimited set of pixmaps containing  the
              icon(s)  to  display  on the button. FvwmWharf will
              search through the path specified in  the  IconPath
              or  PixmapPath configuration items to find the icon
              file.

              NOTE: Icons must have one transparent pixel or  the
              definition  of  a  transparent color in order to be
              valid.
              will  appear  pushed  in  until the mouse button is
              released.

              A single extension to the Fvwm built-in command set
              is provided.  A command of the form:

              *FvwmWharf junk clock.xpm Swallow "Clock" asclock -shape -12 &amp;

              will  cause  FvwmWharf to spawn an asclock process,
              and capture the first window whose name or resource
              is  "Clock", and display it in the button-bar. This
              is  handy  for  applications  like  xclock,  xbiff,
              xload,  asclock,  and  asmail. Modules can be swal-
              lowed by specifying  SwallowModule instead of  just
              "swallow" NOTE: if you use xclock for this applica-
              tion, you will want to specify xclock -padding 0.

              For certain applications that overrun the 48  pixel
              by  48  pixel boundary of FvwmWharf icons and Swal-
              lowed programs there is  a  special  option  called
              <I>MaxSwallow.</I>   <I>MaxSwallow</I> will allow the application
              to draw itself larger than the 48x48 boundary.   It
              is invoked the same way Swallow is.

              To create folder "slide-outs" in <B>FvwmWharf</B> the fol-
              lowing format must be used:

              *FvwmWharf files Folders.xpm Folder
              *FvwmWharf xftp 3DRings.xpm   Exec xftp &amp;
              *FvwmWharf xdir FolderDeposit.xpm Exec xdir &amp;
              *FvwmWharf moxfm FilingCabinet.xpm Exec moxfm &amp;
              *FvwmWharf ~Folders

              The first line of this  set  tells  FvwmWharf  that
              this  button  definition  will be a folder.  All of
              the button definitions between the <I>Folder</I>  and  the
              line  with  the  definition  of <I>*FvwmWharf</I> <I>~Folders</I>
              will appear  on  the  "files"  folder  when  it  is
              exposed.  To expose the "files" folder simply click
              on the FvwmWharf button with the  Folders.xpm  icon
              showing.  A button bar will appear perpendicular to
              your FvwmWharf bar and toward  the  center  of  the
              screen.   On  this  smaller  bar  will be the three
              icons that were configured between the  <I>Folder</I>  and
              <I>~Folder</I>  parts  of the FvwmWharf configuration.  As
              many folder buttons may be configured as is room on
              your  screen.   The only items that may not be con-
              figured within folders are  Swallowed  applications
              and more folders.



</PRE>
<H2>DRAG AND DROP</H2><PRE>
       ton, the following syntax must be adhered to:

       *FvwmWharf     nil      nil        DropExec "<I>program</I>" <I>program</I> %s
       *FvwmWharf     <I>program</I>  <I>iconname</I>   Exec "<I>program</I>" <I>program</I>


       The  button  will  call <I>program</I> when pushed.  If a file is
       dragged onto into it, <I>program</I> will be called with %s being
       replaced by the dropped filename.
