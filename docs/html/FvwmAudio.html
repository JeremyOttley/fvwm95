       <B>FvwmAudio</B> - the FVWM Audio module


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>FvwmAudio</B>  is  spawned by <B>fvwm</B>, so no command line invoca-
       tion will work.  From within the <I>.fvwmrc</I>  file,  <B>FvwmAudio</B>
       is spawned as follows:

       Module FvwmAudio

       or from within an fvwm pop-up menu:

       AddToMenu Module-Popup "Modules"      Title
       +                      "Audio"        Module FvwmAudio
       +                      "Auto"         Module FvwmAuto 200
       +                      "Buttons"      Module FvwmButtons
       +                      "Ident"        Module FvwmIdent
       +                      "Banner"       Module FvwmBanner
       +                      "Pager"        Module FvwmPager 0 3

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  <B>FvwmAudio</B>  module  communicates  with the Fvwm window
       manager to bind audio sounds to  window  manager  actions.
       Different  audio queues may be assigned to any window man-
       ager action.  <B>FvwmAudio</B> can be used with  any  independent
       audio  player,  and  therefore  requires  no special audio
       library APIs of its own.  Simple in its design, it  merely
       binds  the audio filenames to particular actions and forks
       off the audio player program with the appropriate filename
       when that action occurs.

       <B>FvwmAudio</B>  can  also  have  builtin  support for the rplay
       library.



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>FvwmAudio</B> reads the same <I>.fvwm2rc</I> file  as  <B>fvwm(1)</B>  reads
       when  it  starts  up,  and looks for certain configuration
       options:


       *FvwmAudioPlayCmd <I>/usr/bin/X11/demos/auplay</I>
              This determines the independent audio  player  pro-
              gram  that  will  actually play the sounds.  If the
              play command  is  set  to  <I>builtin-rplay</I>  then  the
              builtin rplay support will be used.  For example:

              *FvwmAudioPlayCmd <I>builtin-rplay</I>


       *FvwmAudioDir <I>/usr/lib/sounds</I>
              Specifies  the  directory  to  look  for  the audio
              Specifies  that sound events will only be played if
              they occur at least 5 seconds  after  the  previous
              event.   Sounds  events that occur during the delay
              period are ignored.  This option is useful  if  you
              don't want several sounds playing at the same time.
              The default delay is 0  which  disables  the  audio
              delay.


       *FvwmAudioRplayHost <I>hostname</I>
              Specifies  what  host the sounds will play on.  The
              <I>hostname</I> can also be an environment  variable  such
              as  $HOSTDISPLAY.   This  option is only valid with
              builtin rplay support.


       *FvwmAudioRplayPriority <I>0</I>
              Specifies what priority will  be  assigned  to  the
              sounds  when  they are played.  This option is only
              valid with builtin rplay support.


       *FvwmAudioRplayVolume <I>127</I>
              Specifies what  volume  will  be  assigned  to  the
              sounds  when  they are played.  This option is only
              valid with builtin rplay support.


       *FvwmAudio <I>window-manager</I><B>_</B><I>action</I> <I>audio</I><B>_</B><I>filename</I>
              Binds particular window manager  actions  to  sound
              queues.

              *FvwmAudio startup TaDa.au
              *FvwmAudio shutdown Elvis_Left.au
              *FvwmAudio unknown doh.au
              *FvwmAudio add_window drip.au

              *FvwmAudio focus_change boing.au
              *FvwmAudio destroy_window explosion.au
              *FvwmAudio iconify ploop.au
              *FvwmAudio deiconify ploop.au
              *FvwmAudio toggle_paging fwop.au
              *FvwmAudio new_page beam_trek.au
              *FvwmAudio new_desk beam_trek.au
              *FvwmAudio configure_window huh.au
              *FvwmAudio window_name beep.au
              *FvwmAudio icon_name beep.au
              *FvwmAudio res_class beep.au
              *FvwmAudio res_name beep.au
              *FvwmAudio end_windowlist twang.au

       The  invocation  method was shown in the synopsis section.
       No command line invocation is possible. <B>FvwmAudio</B> must  be
       invoked by the <B>fvwm</B> window manager.



</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       It's REALLY noisy when fvwm starts and restarts.

<H2>COPYRIGHTS</H2><PRE>
       This  module  is  heavily  based  on a similar Fvwm module
       called <B>FvwmSound</B> by Mark  Boyns.  <B>FvwmAudio</B>  simply  takes
       Mark's  original program and extends it to make it generic
       enough to work with any  audio  player.  The  concept  for
       interfacing this module to the Window Manager, is original
       work by Robert Nation.

       or  warranties  or anything are provided or implied in any
       way whatsoever.  Use this program at your own risk.   Per-
       mission  to  use this program for any purpose is given, as
       long as the copyright is kept intact.
