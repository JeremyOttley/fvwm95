       FvwmConsole - the FVWM command input interface


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmConsole is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invoca-
       tion will work.  From within the .fvwm2rc file or  from  a
       menu,  FvwmConsole  takes  any  options  xterm  will take,
       except -e, -name, and -title.

              Module FvwmConsole -g 40x10 -fg black -bg green3

       Also X resources can be set in .Xdefaults file

              FvwmConsole*geometry: 40x4
              FvwmConsole*font: 7x14



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The FvwmConsole allows the user to type fvwm commands into
       xterm,  and have them executed immediately. These commands
       are usually specfified in the .fvwmrc file, or  are  bound
       to  menu/mouse items as specified in that file. This tools
       is  particularly  useful  for  testing  new  configuration
       ideas, or for implementing temporary changes to your envi-
       ronment.

       GNU readline library is called to edit command line.  Also
       a  perl  script is supplied as alternative command editor.
       Its commands are similar to emacs.

              Cntl-A  - begining of line
              Cntl-B  - previous char
              Cntl-D  - delete char
              Cntl-E  - end of line
              Cntl-F  - next char
              Cntl-H  - backspace
              Cntl-K  - erase to the end of line
              Cntl-N  - next line
              Cntl-P  - previous line
              Cntl-R  - search reverse
              Cntl-U  - delete line
              Meta-B  - previous word
              Meta-F  - next word
              Esc &lt;   - begining of history
              Esc &gt;   - end of history

       FvwmConsole  can  be invoked by inserting the line 'Module
       FvwmConsole' in the .fvwmrc file. This can be placed on  a
       line  by  itself,  if  FvwmConsole is to be spawned during
       fvwm's initialization, or can be bound to a menu or  mouse
       button  or  keystroke to invoke it later. Fvwm will search
       directory specified in the ModulePath configuration option
       to attempt to locate FvwmConsole.



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmConsole  uses  xterm.  All resources set for xterm are
       inherited unless overiden by command line options.
