       FvwmButtons - the FVWM buttonbox module


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmButtons is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invoca-
       tion will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The FvwmButtons module provides a window of buttons  which
       sits  on  the X terminal's root window. The user can press
       the buttons at any time, and trigger invocation of a user-
       specified  command by the window manager. FvwmButtons only
       works when fvwm is used as the window manager.

       The buttonbox can be of any configuration or geometry, and
       can  have  monochrome  or  color  icons  to  represent the
       actions which would be invoked.



</PRE>
<H2>INITIALIZATION</H2><PRE>
       During initialization, <I>FvwmButtons</I> will search for a  con-
       figuration  file  which  describes the buttonbox geometry,
       color, icons, and actions. The format of this  files  will
       be described later. The configuration file will be the one
       which fvwm used during its initialization.

       To use FvwmButtons with several different  configurations,
       you  can  invoke  FvwmButtons  with an optional parameter,
       which it will use as its name instead (e.g  "Module  Fvwm-
       Buttons  SomeButtons").   SomeButtons  will then read only
       the lines in the configuration file starting with  "*Some-
       Buttons", and not the lines belonging to FvwmButtons.

       You can also specify an optional configuration file to use
       instead of the default fvwm configuration file, by  giving
       a  second argument which is a filename. This will override
       the setting "*FvwmButtonsFile", see below.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
       FvwmButtons can be invoked by inserting the  line  'Module
       FvwmButtons' in the .fvwmrc file. This should be placed in
       the InitFunction if FvwmButtons is to  be  spawned  during
       fvwm's  initialization, or can be bound to a menu or mouse
       button or keystroke to invoke it later. Fvwm  will  search
       directory specified in the ModulePath configuration option
       to attempt to locate FvwmButtons.



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The following options int the .fvwmrc file are  understood
       by FvwmButtons:
              Specifies  the  background color for the buttons. A
              relief and a shadow color will also  be  calculated
              from this.

       *FvwmButtonsColumns <I>columns</I>
              Specifies  the  number  of columns of buttons to be
              created. If unspecified, the number of columns will
              be  set to the number of buttons requested, divided
              by the number of rows. If both the rows and columns
              are  specified,  but do not specify as many buttons
              as are defined, then the users  columns  specifica-
              tion will be ignored.

       *FvwmButtonsFile <I>filename</I>
              Specifies that the configuration for this button is
              found in the file <I>filename</I>, which will have  to  be
              given  with  full  pathname, or is assumed to be in
              fvwm's startup directory. The configuration file is
              in  the  same  format as fvwm's configuration file,
              but each line is read as if prefixed by  "*FvwmBut-
              tons".  Comments  are given by starting a line with
              "#", line continuation is done  by  ending  a  line
              with a "\".

       *FvwmButtonsFont <I>font</I>
              Specifies the font to be used for labeling the but-
              tons, or <I>None</I>.

       *FvwmButtonsFore <I>color</I>
              Specifies the color used for button label text  and
              monochrome icons.

       *FvwmButtonsFrame <I>width</I>
              Specifies  the width of the relief around each but-
              ton. If this is given as  a  negative  number,  the
              relief will at all times be the inverse of the nor-
              mal relief. In effect, you will get a  sunken  but-
              ton, which is raised when activated.

       *FvwmButtonsGeometry <I>geometry</I>
              Specifies the FvwmButtons window location. The size
              should not be specified, as  FvwmButtons  automati-
              cally  chooses  a size which gracefully accomodates
              all its buttons. The geometry  is  a  standard  X11
              window geometry specification.

       *FvwmButtonsPadding <I>width</I> <I>height</I>
              The  amount of free space between the relief of the
              button and its contents is normally 2 pixels to the
              sides  and  4  pixels  above  and below, except for
              swallowed windows and  containers,  which  are  not
              padded  at  all, unless given specific orders. This
              <I>height</I> pixels.

       *FvwmButtonsRows <I>rows</I>
              Specifies the number of rows of buttons to be  cre-
              ated. If unspecified, 2 rows will be used.

       *FvwmButtons(<I>options</I>) [<I>title</I> <I>icon</I> <I>command</I>]
              Specifies  the  contents of a button in the button-
              box.  The following <I>options</I>, separated by commas or
              whitespace, can be given a button:

         <I>width</I>x<I>height</I>
              The  button  will  be <I>width</I> times the normal button
              width and <I>height</I> times the normal button height.

         Action [(<I>options</I>)] <I>command</I>
              Specifies an fvwm command to be executed  when  the
              button  is  activated by pressing return or a mouse
              button. If <I>command</I> contains whitespace it  must  be
              quoted. The current options are:

              Mouse  <I>n</I>  -  this action is only executed for mouse
              button <I>n</I>.  One actions  can  be  defined  for  each
              mouse button, in addition to the general action.

         Back <I>color</I>
              Specifies  the  background color to be used drawing
              this box. A relief color and a  shadow  color  will
              also be calculated from this.

         Container [(<I>options</I>)]
              Specifies that this button will contain a miniature
              buttonbox, more or less  equivalent  to  swallowing
              another  FvwmButtons  module.  The  options are the
              same as can be given for a single button, but  they
              affect all the contained buttons. Options available
              for this  use  are  <I>Back,</I>  <I>Font,</I>  <I>Fore,</I>  <I>Frame</I>  and
              <I>Padding</I>. Flags for Title and Swallow options can be
              set  with  <I>Title(flags)</I>  and  <I>Swallow(flags</I>.    You
              should also specify either "Columns <I>width</I>" or "Rows
              <I>height</I>", or "Rows 2" will be assumed for purpose of
              arranging  the buttons inside the container. For an
              example, see the <I>Sample</I> <I>configuration</I> section.

              The container button itself (separate from the con-
              tents)  can  take  format  options  like  <I>Frame</I> and
              <I>Padding</I>, and commands can  be  bound  to  it.  This
              means you can make a sensitive relief around a con-
              tainer, like

                *FvwmButtons(2x2, Frame 5, Padding  2  2,  Action
              Beep,\
              tainer a size setting <I>width</I>x<I>height</I>.


         End  Specifies that no more buttons are defined for  the
              current  container, and further buttons will be put
              in the container's parent. This  option  should  be
              given on a line by itself, i.e

                *FvwmButtons(End)

         Font <I>fontname</I>
              Specifies  that the font <I>fontname</I> is to be used for
              labeling this button.

         Fore <I>color</I>
              Specifies a color of the title and monochrome icons
              in this button.

         Frame <I>width</I>
              The relief of the button will be <I>width</I> pixels wide.
              If <I>width</I> is given as a negative number, the  relief
              will  at  all  times  be  the inverse of the normal
              relief.  In effect, you will get a  sunken  button,
              which is raised when activated.

         Icon <I>filename</I>
              The  name  of  an X11 bitmap file or XPM color icon
              file, containing the icon to display on the button.
              FvwmButtons  will search through the path specified
              in the fvwm IconPath  or  PixmapPath  configuration
              items to find the icon file.

         NoSize
              This  option specifies that this button will not be
              considered at all when making the initial  calcula-
              tions  of  buttonsizes.  Useful  for the odd button
              that gets just a couple of pixels to large to  keep
              in  line,  and therefor blows up your whole button-
              box. "NoSize" is equivalent to "Size 0 0".

         Padding <I>width</I> <I>height</I>
              The amount of free space between the relief of  the
              button and its contents is normally 2 pixels to the
              sides and 4 pixels  above  and  below,  except  for
              swallowed  windows  and  containers,  which  are by
              default not padded at all.  This  option  sets  the
              horizontal   padding  to  <I>width</I>  and  the  vertical
              padding to <I>height</I>.

         Size <I>width</I> <I>height</I>
              Specifies that the contents  of  this  button  will
              require  <I>width</I> by <I>height</I> pixels, regardless of what
              not get very large without this  option  specified,
              as FvwmButtons does not consider sizes for swallow-
              ing buttons. Note that this option gives the  mini-
              mum  space assured; other buttons might require the
              buttonbox to use larger sizes.

         Swallow [(<I>flags</I>)] <I>hangon</I> <I>command</I>
              Causes FvwmButtons to execute <I>command</I>, and  when  a
              window matching the name <I>hangon</I> appears, it is cap-
              tured and swallowed into this button.  An example:

                *FvwmButtons(Swallow XClock 'Exec xclock &amp;')

              will take the first window  whose  name,  class  or
              resource  is "XClock" and display it in the button.
              Modules can be swallowed by specifying  the  module
              instead of 'Exec whatever', like:

                *FvwmButtons(Swallow "FvwmPager" "FvwmPager 0 0")

              The flags that can be given to swallow are:

              NoClose / Close - Specifies whether  the  swallowed
              program  in  this  button  will  be  unswallowed or
              closed when FvwmButtons exit cleanly. "NoClose" can
              be  combined  with "UseOld" to have windows survive
              restart of windowmanager. The  default  setting  is
              "Close".

              NoHints  / Hints - Specifies whether hints from the
              swallowed program in this button will be ignored or
              not, useful in forcing a window to resize itself to
              fit its button. The default value is "Hints".

              NoKill / Kill -  Specifies  whether  the  swallowed
              program  will be closed by killing it or by sending
              a message to it. This can be useful in ending  pro-
              grams  that doesn't accept window manager protocol.
              The default value is "NoKill".  This has no  effect
              if "NoClose" is specified.

              NoRespawn  /  Respawn - Specifies whether the swal-
              lowed program is to be  respawn  if  it  dies.   If
              "Respawn"   is   specified,  the  program  will  be
              respawned using  the  original  <I>command</I>.  Use  this
              option  with  care,  the  program might have a very
              legitimate reason to die.

              NoOld / UseOld - Specifies whether the button  will
              try  to  swallow  an  existing  window matching the
              <I>hangon</I> name before spawning one  itself  with  <I>com-</I>
              <I>mand</I>.   The default value is "NoOld".  "UseOld" can
              to swallow an old window, and not spawn one  itself
              if failing, let the <I>command</I> be "Nop":

                *FvwmButtons(Swallow (UseOld) "Console" Nop)

              If  you  want to be able to start it yourself, com-
              bine it with an action:

                *FvwmButtons(Swallow (UseOld) "Console" Nop, \
                             Action `Exec "Console" console &amp;`)

              NoTitle / UseTitle - Specifies whether the title of
              the  button  will  be taken from the swallowed win-
              dow's title or not. If  "UseTitle"  is  given,  the
              title  on  the  button  will  change dynamically to
              reflect the window name. The default is  "NoTitle".


         Title [(<I>options</I>)] <I>name</I>
              Specifies  the  title  which will be written on the
              button.  Whitespace can be included in the title by
              quoting  it.  If a title at any time is to long for
              its buttons, characters are chopped  of  one  at  a
              time  until  it  fits.   If <I>justify</I> is "Right", the
              head is removed, otherwise  its  tail  is  removed.
              These <I>options</I> can be given to Title:

              Center  -  The title will be centered horizontally.
              This is the default.

              Left - The title will  be  justified  to  the  left
              side.

              Right  -  The  title will be justified to the right
              side.

              Side - This will cause the title to appear  on  the
              right  hand  side  of any icon or swallowed window,
              instead of below it which is the default.   If  you
              use  small  icons, and combine this with the "Left"
              option, you can get a look similar to fvwm's menus.

       Legacy fields [<I>title</I> <I>icon</I> <I>command</I>]
              These fields are kept for compatibility with previ-
              ous versions of FvwmButtons, and their use is  dis-
              couraged.  The <I>title</I> field is similar to the option
              Title <I>name</I>. If the title field  is  "-",  no  title
              will  be  displayed.   The <I>icon</I> field is similar to
              the option Icon <I>filename</I>. If the icon field is  "-"
              no  icon  will  be displayed.  The <I>command</I> field is
              similar to the option Action  <I>command</I>  or  alterna-
              tively Swallow "<I>hangon</I>" <I>command</I>.
              Any  fvwm command is recognized by FvwmButtons. See
              <B>fvwm(1)</B> for more info on this. The Exec command has
              a  small extension when used in Actions, its syntax
              is here:

                Exec ["hangon"] command

              When FvwmButtons finds such an  Exec  command,  the
              button  will  remain pushed in until a window whose
              name or class matches the  qouted  portion  of  the
              command is encountered. This is intended to provide
              visual feedback to the user that the action he  has
              requested  will be performed. If the qouted portion
              contains no characters, then the  button  will  pop
              out  immediately.   Note  that  users  can continue
              pressing the button, and re-executing the  command,
              even when it looks "pressed in."

       Quoting
              Any   string  which  contains  whitespace  must  be
              quoted. This include commands.  Quoting can be done
              with  any of the three quotation characters; single
              quote:

                'This is a "quote"',

              double quote:

                "It's another `quote'",

              and backquote:

                `This is a strange quote`.

              The backquoting is purposeful if you use a  prepro-
              cessor  like  FvwmCpp  and want it to get into your
              commands, like this:

                #define BG gray60
                *FvwmButtons(Swallow "xload" `Exec xload  -bg  BG
              &amp;`)



</PRE>
<H2>ARRANGEMENT ALGORITHM</H2><PRE>
       FvwmButtons  tries  to arrange its buttons as best it can,
       by using recursively, on each container including the but-
       tonbox itself, the following algorithm.

       Getting the size right
              First it calculates the number of button unit areas
              it will need, by adding the width times the  height
              in  buttons  of each button. Containers are for the
              the number of rows is given, it will calculate  how
              many  columns are needed, and stick to that, unless
              <I>columns</I> is larger, in which case you will get  some
              empty space at the bottom of the buttonbox.  If the
              number of columns is given, it calculates how  many
              rows  it  needs to fit all the buttons.  If neither
              is given, it assumes you want two rows,  and  finds
              the number of columns from that.

       Shuffling buttons
              Now it has a large enough area to place the buttons
              in, all that is left is to place  them  right.  The
              algorithm assumes the buttons are all of unit size,
              and places them in a left to right, top  to  bottom
              western  fashion.   Then  it looks at button 1, and
              considers: Is this button larger than  normal?   If
              it  isn't, the same thing is done for the next but-
              tons.  When a button is found that is  larger  than
              1x1,  space  must be provided for it. The algorithm
              assumes it is in the right  coordinate,  its  upper
              left  corner  should be unchanged. It then "slides"
              away the buttons that occupies  the  places  needed
              for this button. The buttons are slid to the right,
              wrapping around to the  next  line.  When  all  the
              space  has  been  cleared for this button the algo-
              rithm continues with the  next  button,  doing  the
              same.

       Containers
              Containers  are  arranged by the same algorithm, in
              fact they are shuffled recursively as the algorithm
              finds them.

       Clarifying example
              An example might be useful here: Suppose you have 6
              buttons, all unit sized except number two, which is
              2x2. This makes for 5 times 1 plus 1 times 4 equals
              9  unit  buttons  total  area.  Assume   you   have
              requested 3 columns.

              1) +---+---+---+   2) +---+---+---+   3) +---+---+---+
                 | 1 | 2 | 3 |      | 1 | 2 |   |      | 1 | 2 |   |
                 +---+---+---+      +---+---+---+      +---+---+---+
                 | 4 | 5 | 6 |      | 3 | 4 | 5 |      | 3 |   | 4 |
                 +---+---+---+      +---+---+---+      +---+---+---+
                 |           |      | 6 |       |      | 5 | 6 |   |
                 +-----------+      +---+-------+      +---+---+---+

              4) +---+---+---+   5) +---+-------+
                 | 1 | 2 |   |      | 1 |       |
                 +---+---+---+      +---+   2   |
                 | 3 |   |   |      | 3 |       |
                 +---+---+---+      +---+---+---+

              The  algorithm  starts  as  in  figure 1. The first
              large button it finds is number 2, and it will  try
              to free up each of the unit areas it occupies, in a
              left to right, top to bottom order. First  it  sees
              that  button 3 is in its way, and it shifts all the
              buttons, giving figure 2. Now it finds that  button
              4  is  in  the  way,  so button 4 to 6 are shifted,
              yielding  figure  3.  Button  4  is  still  barring
              progress,  so  it  shifts  button 4 to 6 once more,
              ending up at figure 4. Now  all  the  button  units
              required by button 2 are freed, and button 2 can be
              given its real size.

       What size will the buttons be?
              When FvwmButtons has read the icons and fonts  that
              are  required by its configuration, it can find out
              which size is needed for every non-swallowing  but-
              ton.  The unit button size of a container is set to
              be large enough to hold the largest  button  in  it
              without  squeezing it. Swallowed windows are simple
              expected to be comfortable with the buttonsize they
              get from this scheme. If a particular configuration
              requires more space for a swallowed window, it  can
              be  set  in  that button's configuration line using
              the option "Size  <I>width</I>  <I>height</I>".  This  will  tell
              FvwmButtons  to  give this button at least <I>width</I> by
              <I>height</I> pixels inside the relief and padding.

       The  last  lines are a little tricky - one spawns an Fvwm-
       Pager module, and captures it to display  in  a  quadruple
       width button.  is used, the Pager will be as big as possi-
       ble within the button's relief.

       The final line is even more magic. Note the combination of
       <I>UseOld</I>  and  <I>NoKill</I>, which will try to swallow an existing
       window with the name "xload15" when starting up (if  fail-
       ing:  starting  one  with the specified command), which is
       unswallowed when ending FvwmButtons.

       The color specification <I>rgb:90/80/90</I> is actually the  most
       correct  way  of  specifying  independent colors in X, and
       should be used instead of the older <I>#908090</I>. If the latter
       specification  is  used  in  your  configuration file, you
       should be sure to escape the hash in any of  the  <I>command</I>s
       which  will be executed, or fvwm will consider the rest of
       the line a comment.
