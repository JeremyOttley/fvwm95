       FvwmM4 - the FVWM  M4 pre-processor


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmM4  is  spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation
       will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       When called, this module will attempt to have M4  pre-pro-
       cess  the  file specified in its invocation, and then have
       fvwm read the resulting file.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
       FvwmM4 can be invoked by inserting the  line  'FvwmM4'  in
       the  .fvwmrc  file.  It  can also be called from a menu or
       mouse binding.  If the user wants his entire .fvwmrc  file
       pre-processed  with FvwmM4, then fvwm should be invoked as
       fvwm -f "FvwmM4 .fvwmrc". Note that the  argument  to  the
       option  "-f"  should  be  enclosed in quotes, and no other
       quoting should be used. For example, a typical  invocation
       might be

            fvwm -f "FvwmM4 -m4-squote { -m4-equote } .fvwmrc"


       Some options can be specified on the command line:

       -m4-prefix
              I  think  this  makes all the m4 directives require
              the prefix "m4_".


       -m4opt Lets you pass an option to the m4 program.


       -m4-squote
              Lets you change the m4 start-of-quote character  to
              <I>character</I>.

       -m4-equote
              Lets  you  change  the m4 end-of-quote character to
              <I>character</I>.

       -m4prog
              Instead of invoking "m4", fvwm will invoke <I>name</I>.

       -debug Causes the  temporary  file  create  by  m4  to  be
              retained.  This file is usually called "/tmp/fvwmr-
              cXXXXXX"


       FvwmM4 defines some values for use  in  the  pre-processor
       file:


       TWM_TYPE
              Always set to "fvwm".

       SERVERHOST
              The name of the machine running the X Server.

       CLIENTHOST
              The name of the machine running fvwm.

       HOSTNAME
              The hostname of the machine running fvwm. Generally
              the same as CLIENTHOST.

       OSTYPE The operating system for CLIENTHOST.

       USER   The name of the person running fvwm.

       VERSION
              The X11 version.

       REVISION
              The X11 revision number.

       VENDOR The X server vendor.

       RELEASE
              The X server release number.

       WIDTH  The screen width in pixels.

       HEIGHT The screen height in pixels.

       X_RESOLUTION
              Some distance/pixel measurement for the  horizontal
              direction, I think.

       Y_RESOLUTION
              Some  distance/pixel  measurement  for the vertical
              direction, I think.

       PLANES Number of color planes for the X server display

       BITS_PER_RGB
              Number of bits in each rgb triplet.

       CLASS  The X11 visual class, ie PsuedoColor.

       COLOR  Yes or No, Yes if  the  display  class  is  neither
              The fvwm version number, ie 2.0

       OPTIONS
              Some  combination of SHAPE, XPM, NO_SAVEUNDERS, and
              M4, as defined in configure.h at compile time.

       FVWMDIR
              The directory where fvwm looks for .fvwmrc and mod-
              ules by default, as determined at compile time.

       FvwmM4  is  the  result of a random bit mutation on a hard
       disk, presumably a result of a  cosmic-ray  or  some  such
       thing.
