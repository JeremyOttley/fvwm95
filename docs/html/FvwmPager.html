       FvwmPager - the FVWM Pager module


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmPager  is  spawned by fvwm, so no command line invoca-
       tion will work.  From within the .fvwmrc  file,  FvwmPager
       is spawned as follows:

       Module FvwmPager 0 3

       or from within an fvwm pop-up menu:

       AddToMenu Module-Popup "Modules"      Title
       +                      "Audio"        Module FvwmAudio
       +                      "Auto"         Module FvwmAuto 200
       +                      "Buttons"      Module FvwmButtons
       +                      "Ident"        Module FvwmIdent
       +                      "Banner"       Module FvwmBanner
       +                      "Pager"        Module FvwmPager 0 3

       where  "0"  is  the  first desktop to show, and "3" is the
       last.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The FvwmPager module shows a miniature view  of  the  Fvwm
       desktops  which are specified in the command line. This is
       a useful reminder of where your active windows  are.  Win-
       dows  in  the  pager  are shown in the same color as their
       fvwm decorations.

       The pager can be used to change  your  viewport  into  the
       current  desktop,  to  change desktops, or to move windows
       around.

       Pressing mouse button 1 in the pager will cause you  view-
       port  to change to the selected page of the selected desk.
       If you click with button 1 in  the  desk-label  area,  you
       will switch desks but not pages within the desk.

       Dragging  mouse  button  2 on a miniature view of a window
       will cause that window to be move to  the  location  where
       you  release  the mouse button, but your viewport will not
       change. If you drag the window out of the pager  and  onto
       your  desktop, a full size image of the window will appear
       for you to place. There is no way to pick up a  full  size
       image  of  the window and move it into the pager, however.
       Since some mice do not have button 2, I have  made  provi-
       sions to drag windows in the pager by using pressing modi-
       fier-1 (usually Alt) and dragging with button 3.

       Clicking mouse button 3 on a location within  the  current
       desktop  will  cause  the viewport to move to the selected
       move as you drag. Button 3 operations are limited  to  the
       current desktop only.

       When  iconified, the pager will work as a fully functional
       current page only pager.  Windows  and  viewports  can  be
       moved  within  the  icon  of the pager. Users will want to
       make sure that they have no lines similar to

       Icon "Fvwm Pager" whatever

       in their .fvwmrc files.

       this  module  to the Window Manager, are all original work

<H2>INITIALIZATION</H2><PRE>
       During initialization, <I>FvwmPager</I> will eventually search  a
       configuration  file  which  describes  the  time-outs  and
       actions to take.  The configuration file is the same  file
       that fvwm used during initialization.

       If  the FvwmPager executable is linked to another name, ie
       ln -s FvwmPager OtherPager,  then  another  module  called
       OtherPager  can  be  started,  with a completely different
       configuration than FvwmPager, simply by changing the  key-
       word   FvwmPager  to  OtherPager.  This way multiple pager
       programs can be used.



</PRE>
<H2>KEYBOARD FOCUS CONTROL</H2><PRE>
       You can direct the keyboard focus to  any  window  on  the
       current  desktop by clicking with button 2 on its image in
       the pager. The window does not need to be visible, but  it
       does need to be on the current page.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
       The invocation method was shown in the synopsis section


       FvwmPager  reads  the same .fvwmrc file as fvwm reads when
       it starts up, and looks for certain configuration options:


       *FvwmPagerGeometry <I>geometry</I>
              Completely or partially specifies the pager windows
              location and geometry, in  standard  X11  notation.
              In  order  to maintain an undistorted aspect ratio,
              you might want to leave out  either  the  width  or
              height dimension of the geometry specification


       *FvwmPagerRows <I>rows</I>
              Tells  fvwm how many rows of desks to use when lay-
              ing out the pager window.


       *FvwmPagerColumns <I>columns</I>
              Tells fvwm how many columnss of desks to  use  when
              laying out the pager window.


       *FvwmPagerIconGeometry <I>geometry</I>
              Specifies a size (optional) and location (optional)
              for the pager's icon window. Since there is no easy
              way  for  FvwmPager  to determine the height of the
              icon's label, you will have to  make  an  allowance
              for  the  icon  label height when using negative y-
              coordinates  in  the  icon  location  specification
              (used  to specify a location relative to the bottom
              instead of the top of the screen).


       *FvwmPagerStartIconic
              Causes the pager to start iconified.


       *FvwmPagerFont <I>font-name</I>
              Specified a font to use to label the  desktops.  If
              <I>font</I><B>_</B><I>name</I>  is "none" then no desktop labels will be
              displayed.


       *FvwmPagerSmallFont <I>font-name</I>
              Specified a font to use to label the  window  names
              in  the  pager. If not specified, the window labels
              will be omitted. Window labels seem  to  be  fairly
              useless for desktop scales of 32 or greater.


       *FvwmPagerFore <I>color</I>
              Specifies  the  color  to  use to write the desktop
              Specifies the background color for the window.


       *FvwmPagerHilight <I>color</I>
              The active page and desk label will be  highlighted
              by  using  this  background  pattern instead of the
              normal background.


       *FvwmPagerLabel <I>desk</I> <I>label</I>
              Assigns the text <I>label</I> to desk <I>desk</I>  in  the  pager
              window.   Useful  for  assigning  symbolic names to
              desktops, ie

              *FvwmPagerLabel 1 Mail
              *FvwmPagerLabel 2 Maker
              *FvwmPagerLabel 2 Matlab



       *FvwmPagerDeskColor <I>desk</I> <I>color</I>
              Assigns the color <I>color</I> to desk <I>desk</I> in  the  pager
              window.  This replaces the background color for the
              particular <I>desk</I>.  This only works when the pager is
              full  sized.   When  Iconified,  the pager uses the
              color specified by *FvwmPagerBack.

              <B>TIP:</B> Try using *FvwmPagerDeskColor  in  conjunction
              with  FvwmCpp  (or FvwmM4) and FvwmBacker to assign
              identical colors to your various desktops  and  the
              pager representations.


       *FvwmPagerDeskTopScale <I>number</I>
              If  the  geometry  is not specified, then a desktop
              reduction factor is used to calculate  the  pager's
              size.  Things  in  the  pager  window  are shown at
              1/<I>number</I> of the actual size.
