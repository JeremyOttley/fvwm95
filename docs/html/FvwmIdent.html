       FvwmIdent - the FVWM identify-window module


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmIdent  is  spawned by fvwm, so no command line invoca-
       tion will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The FvwmIdent module prompts the user to select  a  target
       window,  if the module was not launched from within a win-
       dow context in Fvwm.  After that, it pops up a window with
       information about the window which was selected.

       FvwmIdent  reads  the same .fvwmrc file as fvwm reads when
       it starts up, and looks for lines similar to  "*FvwmIdent-
       Fore green".

<H2>COPYRIGHTS</H2><PRE>
       The  FvwmIdent  program,  and  the concept for interfacing
       this module to the Window Manager, are all  original  work
       by Robert Nation Nobutaka Suzuki.

<H2>INITIALIZATION</H2><PRE>
       During  initialization, <I>FvwmIdent</I> will eventually search a
       configuration file which describes the colors and font  to
       use.   The  configuration  file is the same file that fvwm
       used during initialization.

       If the FvwmIdent executable is linked to another name,  ie
       ln  -s  FvwmIdent MoreIdentify, then another module called
       MoreIdentify can be started, with a  completely  different
       configuration  than FvwmIdent, simply by changing the key-
       word  FvwmIdent to MoreIdentify. This way  multiple  clut-
       ter-reduction programs can be used.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
       FvwmIdent  can  be  invoked  by binding the action 'Module
       FvwmIdent' to a menu or key-stroke in  the  .fvwmrc  file.
       Fvwm  will  search  directory  specified in the ModulePath
       configuration  option  to  attempt  to  locate  FvwmIdent.
       Although  nothing  keeps  you  from launching FvwmIdent at
       start-up time, you probably don't want to.
       FvwmIdent reads the same .fvwmrc file as fvwm  reads  when
       it starts up, and looks for lines as listed below:


       *FvwmIdentFore <I>color</I>
              Tells  the module to use <I>color</I> instead of black for
              text.


       *FvwmIdentBack <I>color</I>
              Tells the module to use <I>color</I> instead of black  for
              the window background.


       *FvwmIdentFont <I>fontname</I>
              Tells  the  module to use <I>fontname</I> instead of fixed
              for text.
