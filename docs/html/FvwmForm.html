       FvwmForm - input form module for Fvwm


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmForm  must  be spawned by Fvwm.  It will not work from
       the command line.


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       FvwmForm provides a mechanism to get user  input  and  act
       accordingly.  This is achieved by means of a form that the
       user can fill out, and from  which  the  user  can  select
       actions  he  wants  Fvwm to take.  A form consists of five
       types of items:  text  labels,  single-line  text  inputs,
       mutually-exclusive selections, multiple-choice selections,
       and action buttons.  These items are arranged into several
       lines, with a very flexible layout.

       A  text  label only serves the purpose of explanation.  It
       cannot accept any input.  A text input field can  be  used
       to  edit  a  single-line  string.  FvwmForm accepts Emacs-
       style cursor movement keys.  No copying and pasting  func-
       tions exist.

       A  selection  consists  of several choices.  The selection
       itself is a logical entity that doesn't have  any  display
       feature.   Each  choice is displayed as a push-button fol-
       lowed by a explanatory  text  label.   When  selected,  an
       exclusive  choice  shows  a  circle in the middle, while a
       multiple choice shows a check.

       An action button, when clicked on, will send a set of com-
       mands to Fvwm.  FvwmForm will do variable substitutions in
       the command text to reflect the user's input.


</PRE>
<H2>INITIALIZATION</H2><PRE>
       FvwmForm uses the same configuration file (usually .fvwmrc
       in  the  user's  home directory) as Fvwm.  To use FvwmForm
       for multiple input forms,  simply  create  symbolic  links
       with  different names, and they will be treated as differ-
       ent modules.  Or, you can invoke FvwmForm with an optional
       parameter,  which  it  will  use as the name instead (e.g.
       'Module FvwmForm QuitVerify').  That way  you  don't  even
       have to make a symbolic link for it!

       Be  sure to set ModulePath in your .fvwmrc file to include
       FvwmForm's path.

       When FvwmForm is invoked with a window context, e.g.  from
       a  window  menu,  all  commands it sends to Fvwm will have
       that window context.


</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION</H2><PRE>
       The following options can be  set  in  the  .fvwmrc  file.

       The order of the options DOES matter.  In general,  colors
       and  fonts should be specified first.  Lines, text labels,
       and input items should appear in their logical order.

       <B>*FvwmFormGrabServer</B>
           This option makes FvwmForm grab the mouse  pointer  on
           startup.   This  feature  is  useful  for  things like
           logout verification.

       <B>*FvwmFormWarpPointer</B>
           This option makes FvwmForm warp the mouse pointer into
           its  window on startup.  It saves the user some mouse-
           travelling.

       <B>*FvwmFormPosition</B> <I>x</I> <I>y</I>
           Puts the FvwmForm window at location  (<I>x</I>,  <I>y</I>)  on  the
           screen.   By  convention, a negative <I>x</I> (resp. <I>y</I>) value
           measures distance from the right (resp. bottom) of the
           screen.

           If  this option is omitted, FvwmForm will start at the
           center of the screen.

       <B>*FvwmFormBack</B> <I>color</I>
           Specifies the background color of the FvwmForm window.

       <B>*FvwmFormFore</B> <I>color</I>
           Specifies  the  foreground  color for displaying plain
           text.

       <B>*FvwmFormItemBack</B> <I>color</I>
           Specifies the background color for the text input win-
           dows, and the buttons.

       <B>*FvwmFormItemFore</B> <I>color</I>
           Specifies  the  foreground  color  for  the text input
           strings and button markers.

       <B>*FvwmFormFont</B> <I>font</I>
           Specifies the font for displaying plain text.

       <B>*FvwmFormButtonFont</B> <I>font</I>
           Specifies the font for text marked in the action  but-
           tons.

       <B>*FvwmFormInputfont</B> <I>font</I>
           Specifies  the  font  for  text input.  This font must
           have fixed width.

       <B>*FvwmFormLine</B> <I>justification</I>
           Starts a new line.  A line can  contain  an  arbitrary
           The width of the window is that of the longest line.

           Justification  of  items  in  the line is specified by
           <I>justification</I>, which can be one of the following:

       <I>left</I>            Items are justified to  the  left  of  the
                       window.

       <I>right</I>           Items  are  justified  to the right of the
                       window.

       <I>center</I>          Items are placed in the center of the win-
                       dow.

       <I>expand</I>          If there is only one item in the line, the
                       item is centered in the window.  If two or
                       more  items are present, they are spreaded
                       to fill the whole width of the window.

       <B>*FvwmFormText</B> <I>string</I>
           Displays <I>string</I> as plain text.  Line  breaks  must  be
           achieved  by  multiple *FvwmFormLine and *FvwmFormText
           options.  Blanks may be used to provide extra  padding
           between items.

       <B>*FvwmFormInput</B> <I>name</I> <I>size</I> <I>init</I><B>_</B><I>string</I>
           Specifies a text input item with name <I>name</I>.  A subwin-
           dow of <I>size</I> characters in width will be used for edit-
           ting.   If <I>init</I><B>_</B><I>string</I> is present, it will be the ini-
           tial string when FvwmForm  starts  or  resets  itself.
           The default initial string is "".

       <B>*FvwmFormSelection</B> <I>name</I> <I>type</I>
           This  option  starts  a selection item with name <I>name</I>.
           Its choices should  be  specified  on  the  subsequent
           lines.  The option <I>type</I> is one of the following:

       <I>single</I>          The selections are mutually exclusive.

       <I>multiple</I>        This is a multiple-choice selection.

       <B>*FvwmFormChoice</B> <I>name</I> <I>value</I> <B>on</B> <B>|</B> <B>off</B> <I>string</I>
           Specifies  a  choice for a selection.  The choice item
           has a <I>name</I> and a <I>value</I>.  The <I>string</I> will be  displayed
           to the right of the choice button as a label.

           The  choice  will  assume  the specified initial state
           ("on" means selected) when FvwmForm starts or  resets.
           Note  that  if  the selections are mutually exclusive,
           FvwmForm will NOT detect inconsistencies in  the  ini-
           tial  states  of  the choices, i.e. two or none of the
           choices can  be  selected.   However,  once  the  user

       <B>*FvwmFormButton</B> <I>type</I> <I>string</I> <B>[</B><I>key</I><B>]</B>
           This option specifies an action  button.   The  button
           has  <I>string</I> as a label, and excutes a set of Fvwm <I>com-</I>
           <I>mand</I> when it is activated.   The  commands  should  be
           specified using the *FvwmFormCommand option.

           The  optional  <I>key</I>  specifies a keyboard shortcut that
           activates the button.  It is in either a control char-
           acter,  specified  as  ^@,  ^A, ..., ^_, or a function
           key, specified as F1, F2, ..., F35.  Control keys that
           are used for cursor movement in text input fields can-
           not activate any buttons, with the exception  of  TAB,
           RETURN, LINEFEED, which can activate a button when the
           cursor is in the last text input field.

           The behavior of the button is determined by <I>type</I>:

       continue        FvwmForm will resume execution after send-
                       ing the commands.

       restart         After  sending the commands, FvwmForm will
                       reset all the values to the initial  ones,
                       and then resume execution.

       quit            FvwmForm  will quit after sending the com-
                       mands.

       <B>*FvwmFormCommand</B> <I>command</I>
           This option specifies an Fvwm command associated  with
           the  current  button.  Commands that appear before any
           *FvwmFormButton option will be  executed  at  start-up
           time.   This  is  usually  a beep that gets the user's
           attention.

           Before sending each command to Fvwm,  FvwmForm  recog-
           nizes  variables  of  the  following forms, and supply
           values to them.

       <B>$(</B><I>name</I><B>)</B>         If <I>name</I> corresponds to a text input field,
                       the  result  is  the  user's input string.
                       Special chars such as ", ', and   will  be
                       preceded by a backslash.

                       If  <I>name</I>  corresponds  to  a  choice,  the
                       result is the  value  of  the  choice  (as
                       specified   in   *FvwmFormChoice)  if  the
                       choice is selected.  If the choice is  not
                       selected, the result is a blank string.

                       If  <I>name</I>  corresponds  to a selection, the
                       result will be a list of the selected val-
                       value is not an empty string,  the  result
                       is <I>string</I>, with recursive variable substi-
                       tution applied.  If  the  input  value  is
                       empty, the result is empty.

                       If  <I>name</I>  is  a choice and it is selected,
                       the result is <I>string</I>, with recursive vari-
                       able  substitution applied.  If the choice
                       is not selected, the result is empty.

       <B>$(</B><I>name</I><B>!</B><I>string</I><B>)</B>  The same as the  above,  except  that  the
                       converse conditions are taken.
