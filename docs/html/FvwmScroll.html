       FvwmScroll - the FVWM scroll-bar module


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmScroll  is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invoca-
       tion will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The FvwmScroll module prompts the user to select a  target
       window,  if the module was not launched from within a win-
       dow context in Fvwm.  After that, it adds scroll  bars  to
       the  selected  window,  to  reduce the total desktop space
       consumed by the window.


       FvwmScroll reads the same .fvwmrc file as fvwm reads  when
       it starts up, and looks for lines similar to "*FvwmScroll-
       Fore green".

       FvwmScroll should not be used with windows which  move  or
       resize  themselves,  nor  should  it  be used with windows
       which set the WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS property.  Operation  is
       fine with windows that have a private colormap.

<H2>COPYRIGHTS</H2><PRE>
       The  FvwmScroll  program,  and the concept for interfacing
       this module to the Window Manager, are all  original  work
       by Robert Nation.

       or anything are provided or implied in any way whatsoever.

</PRE>
<H2>INITIALIZATION</H2><PRE>
       During initialization, <I>FvwmScroll</I> will eventually search a
       configuration file which describes the colors to use.  The
       configuration  file is the same file that fvwm used during
       initialization.

       If the FvwmScroll executable is linked to another name, ie
       ln  -s  FvwmScroll  MoreScroll, then another module called
       MoreScroll can be started,  with  a  completely  different
       configuration than FvwmScroll, simply by changing the key-
       word  FvwmScroll to MoreScroll.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
       file.  The parameter x and y are integers, which  describe
       the  horizontal  and vertical window size reduction.  Fvwm
       will search directory specified in the ModulePath configu-
       ration  option  to  attempt to locate FvwmScroll. Although
       nothing keeps you from launching  FvwmScroll  at  start-up
       time, you probably don't want to.



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmScroll  reads the same .fvwmrc file as fvwm reads when
       it starts up, and looks for lines as listed below:


       *FvwmScrollFore <I>color</I>
              Tells the module to use <I>color</I> instead of  grey  for
              scroll bars themselves.


       *FvwmScrollBack <I>color</I>
              Tells  the module to use <I>color</I> instead of black for
              the window background.



</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       When the scroll bars are removed by clicking on the button
       in the lower right corner, the window does not restore its
       location correctly.
