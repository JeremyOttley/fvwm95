       FvwmBacker - the FVWM background changer module


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmBacker  is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invoca-
       tion will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The FvwmBacker module provides functionality to change the
       background  when  changing  desktops.   Any command can be
       executed to change the backgrounds.  The commands used  to
       change  the  backgrounds must exit after changing the root
       window, (i.e. 'xv -root zzz.gif'  does  not,  without  the
       -quit option) otherwise FvwmBacker will hang.

<H2>COPYRIGHTS</H2><PRE>
       The FvwmBacker module is the original work of Mike Finger.

       Copyright 1994, Mike Finger. The author makes  no  guaran-
       tees  or warranties of any kind about the use of this mod-
       ule.  Use this modules at your own risk.  You  may  freely
       use  this  module  or any portion of it for any purpose as
       long as the copyright is kept intact.



</PRE>
<H2>INITIALIZATION</H2><PRE>
       During initialization, <I>FvwmBacker</I> will scan the same  con-
       figuration  file that FVWM used during startup to find the
       options that pertain to it.  These options  are  discussed
       in a later section.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
       FvwmBacker can be invoked by fvwm during initialization by
       inserting the line  'Module  FvwmBacker'  in  the  .fvwmrc
       file.

       FvwmBacker  must  reside  in a directory that is listed in
       the ModulePath option of FVWM for it  to  be  executed  by
       FVWM.



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The following is the only supported option at present:


       *FvwmBackerDesk <I>DeskNumber</I> <I>command</I>
              Specifies the <I>command</I> to execute when the specified
              <I>DeskNumber</I> becomes active.

              If the command begins with <I>-solid</I>  FvwmBacker  uses
              ing  a  system  call  to xsetroot. Only single word
              color names may be used.



</PRE>
<H2>SAMPLE CONFIGURATION</H2><PRE>
       The following  are  excepts  from  a  .fvwmrc  file  which
       describe FvwmBacker initialization commands:


       ####
       # Set Up Backgrounds for different desktops.
       ####
       *FvwmBackerDesk 0 -solid steelblue
       *FvwmBackerDesk 1 -solid midnightblue
       *FvwmBackerDesk 2 -solid yellow
       *FvwmBackerDesk 3 xpmroot /usr/include/X11/pixmaps/background2.xpm
